So whatâ€™s the difference between JavaScript and the browser? 

Browser  - act as a client for a web server.
  request resources over the internet (usually HTTP/HTTPS)

To make these interactions work, the browser surfaces APIs. In fact, a large part of what people think of as client-side JavaScript is actually these APIs.
