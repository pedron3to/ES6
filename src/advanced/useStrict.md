 to tell parsers to enforce all JavaScript syntax rules when processing your code

 Strict mode makes several changes to normal JavaScript semantics:

Eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors.
Fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations: strict mode code can sometimes be made to run faster than identical code that's not strict mode.
Prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript.
